Our mission is to enable frictionless liquidity for all cryptoassets by building the first of its kind multi-asset liquidity pool - the HydraDX Omnipool. In the Omnipool, various assets аrе priced against each other by using our pool token Lerna (LRNA) as a proxy for determining their relative value. With the Omnipool, HydraDX breaks with the traditional conception according to which assets are traded in pairs using isolated pools."
