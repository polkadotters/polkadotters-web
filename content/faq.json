    "question": "Why should you support Polkadotters as a validator?",
    "answer": "On one hand, we bring the high-quality of service together with one of the highest APR on our validators in the ecosystem. On the other, you will also help to decentralize Polkadot and its ecocystem by supporting a community validator - which, in turn, will support the ecosystem itself. We are proud to support Polkadot from the early days and we definitely want to give something back in return."
